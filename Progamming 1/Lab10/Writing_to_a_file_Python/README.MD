<b>Writing to a File (Python)</b>
Here we will do something similar as the previous task, but instead of reading from the user, we will copy the contents of one file over to another.

The method copy(from_filename, to_filename) should copy the contents of the file with name from_filename to the file with name to_filename.

There's nothing particularly tricky here, once you know how to open a file in Python, you're about 90% of the way there.
