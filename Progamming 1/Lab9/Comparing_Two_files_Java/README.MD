<b>Comparing Two Files (Java)</b>

For this exercise, we're going to try something new - working with two files at once. This will required two separate input "routes", one for each file. This is an especially opportune moment to employ the try-with-resources structure.

The program will be given two file names, and your task is to complete a method that checks whether those two files have the same contents (as Strings). Again, remember that the String.equals(String) method is your friend here.
