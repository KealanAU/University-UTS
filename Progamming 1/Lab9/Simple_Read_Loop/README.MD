<b>Simple Read Loop</b>

As normal, we start off with an "easy" one. 

The scaffold starts with a partially completed program, and a sample input file foo.txt.

The goal the program is to read in integers from a file, each printed on a separate line (you do not have to validate this), and store them as elements of a list. The program then prints the list to the terminal.

The name of the file will be given as a command line parameter, but you do not have to handle this section.

Your task is to complete the readFile(String) method, which reads the numbers from the file and returns the populated list.
