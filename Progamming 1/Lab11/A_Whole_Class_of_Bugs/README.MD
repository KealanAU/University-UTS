<b>A Whole Class of Bugs!</b>
Okay, things are getting out of hand here. Someone has written a class to help keep track of bugs (have they never heard of a bug tracker? Oh well, any good idea is worth doing yourself because you know better), but it's riddled with bugs. Some are syntactical, some are logical.

Each bug should store a message indicating the cause (or whatever the user wants to record). By default, this should be "Unknown cause".

The class (not the objects) should also keep track of how many bugs have been generated. Each time a bug is created, the counter should be incremented, and each time one is solved, it should be decremented.

The class should also be able to say when the system is bug free (by examining the number of bugs generated).

Each object should also be able to give back its message.

You have explained to the project manager that this should be scrapped and a better approach used, but, misunderstanding the sunk cost fallacy, they've decided that they've paid for it now, so they should make it work.

Of course, you got the job of fixing it...
