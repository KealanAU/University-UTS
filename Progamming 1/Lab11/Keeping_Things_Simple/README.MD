<b>Keeping Things Simple</b>

Complicated code is hard to maintain and hard to understand.

Part of developing a clean programming style is realising what the things you're working with actually do, and how to express things succinctly.

The following code has a method test that is unnecessarily convoluted.

Simplify it. You should be able to get it notable smaller and easier to read. The test will pass when you have short enough code (while still being functional). The main method is already okay (and it probably can't be made meaningfully smaller anyway).
