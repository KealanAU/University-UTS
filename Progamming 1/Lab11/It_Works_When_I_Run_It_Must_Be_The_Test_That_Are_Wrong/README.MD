<b>It works when I run it, it must be the tests that are wrong.</b>

We're back fixing someone else's code again. Our colleague has written a factorial function that takes an int parameter and returns the factorial of that number (the factorial is just the product of all the numbers from 1 to the input number) as a long (they get big quick).

It seems to work some times, and it passed all of our dear colleague's tests. What's missing?

Fix the problem!
