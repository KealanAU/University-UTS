<b> Building and Using Methods </b>
This is the assessment task for this lab. It is due by 9:00AM  on 4/4/2022

For this task, we're going to return to the student marks database exercise, and jazz it up with some methods. The code will be spread over three classes, but some of the basics will be filled in so you don't have to worry too much about how to set up classes and objects. You just have to write methods to move the information around.

The program consists of three classes, Student, StudentDatabase and MarksReport. The program starts by reading in and setting up the data. Your task is to take this data and add methods and code to perform the following (in order):

    Print out "There are nnn students." Where nnn is the number of students.

    Print out "The average mark is xxx." Where xxx is the average mark with decimal places.

    Print out "The best student is <name> with a mark of xxx." Where <name> is the name of the student with the highest mark (the highest mark will be unique) and xxx is the mark.

    Print out "The worst student is <name> with a mark of xxx." Where <name> is the name of the student with the lowest mark (the lowest mark will be unique) and xxx is the mark.

You should not alter any of the existing code given in the scaffold, just add to it. You may need to add code to all three classes. You may wish to take a quick look back at the "Calling Methods" exercise for some inspiration.
