<b>Implementing a Method that Actually Does Something Useful</b>
For this exercise, we'll create a method that does something a little more useful (not a lot though).

The method should take two parameters, an int array, and an int, and return true if the number appears in the array, and false otherwise.

The method should be called contains, and for this exercise should be static.
