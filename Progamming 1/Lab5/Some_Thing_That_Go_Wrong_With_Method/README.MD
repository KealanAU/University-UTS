<b>Some Things That Go Wrong With Methods</b>
There are a number of things that can go wrong when implementing and using methods. Here we have some code that has a number of errors in it. As usual, try running the code, read the error messages and use that information to correct the problems.

The program simply prints out a phrase, but its functionality is obscured by problems with the way the methods are used. You don't need to reorder the code, or restructure the program, all the bugs are simple, common bugs encountered when writing and calling methods.
