<b>Calling Methods in Python</b>
Just to flip things around for a moment, this exercise deals with how to use methods, once they are written.

We have already been doing this throughout the subject so far, but now we can start doing it with things of which we can see the internals.

Here we have a simple temperature database. It stores the last week's temperatures in a list, but has methods to allow rudimentary access by the name of the day.

Your task starts in  main.py, and you have to 

    print out the temperature for each day in the form <day name> was <temperature> (e.g. Monday was 25),

    print out the maximum temperature in the form The maximum was <temperature>

    print out the minimum temperature in the form The minimum was <temperature>

    print out the average temperature in the form The average was <temperature>

You should be able to do all of these by using function calls in the temperature class (already set up with the temps variable in main.py. You should not need to calculate anything yourself. You may want to spend some time perusing temperature.py.
