<b>All the Arithmetic</b>

You have the skeleton of a small program which reads in two values from the user, and store them in variables a and b.

Your job is to add some code that computes a + b, a - b, a  *  b,a / b and a % b, stores them in separate variables, and prints them out to separate lines.
