<b> Practice Submission </b>

There's not really a task here other than to submit your code by hitting "Mark" before 9am on Monday 14/3. You can try and make it pass the test as well, but it's not necessary to get things right in this one.

This is to show you what it looks like when a task is assessable (we have records of all the other submission, it just doesn't show up with a mark, or have a due date, etc.). The main thing to notice in this example is that the test has a point value.
