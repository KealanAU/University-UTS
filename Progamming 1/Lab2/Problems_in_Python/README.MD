<b>Problems in Python</b>

Now we'll take a quick look at what errors in Python look like. They are, in some sense, simpler than in Java, but often much less informative, and normally only detectable when the program is actually run.

In this particular example, there's also some things that Python will appear to allow that Java won't (and this will cause a problem when run), and something that Java will do that Python won't (which will also cause a problem).
