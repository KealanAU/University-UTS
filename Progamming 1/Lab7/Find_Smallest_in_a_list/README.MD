<b> Find Smallest in a List</b>

For this exercise, we'll employ the List interface to abstract implementation details away from the functionality we're implementing.

The task is to write a simple method that takes a List<Integer> as a parameter, and finds the smallest number in the list and returns it as an int. The list will always have something in it, so you don't have to worry about the empty list case. The method should be public, static and called smallest.

The skeleton also has a main method, which you can use for your own test (or anything you want really), it will not be part of the tests.
