<b> The "Did you read the lesson or watch the lecture" Exercise </b>

For the warmup exercise, we'll start with an empty main method, then read in some number and use an ArrayList to store them, then print them out. While we're doing this, we'll also see an alternate version of dealing with unbounded user input (a case an array can't handle).

The task is to create an ArrayList that stores ints (remember it can't directly take primitives as a type parameter, you need to replace it with something), then read in ints from the user and add them to the list until -1 is entered (don't add the -1 to the list). Finally, print out the list. Do this directly, in one statement, without a loop - don't print each element separately.
