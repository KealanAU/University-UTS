<b>Creating a Python Object</b>

This is the same as the previous exercise, but with Python.

Again, all you have to do is create an object of type DontTouch in the function make. You have a __main__ section to run anything you like, but you do not need to use this to solve the exercise.

You do not need to do anything to the class DontTouch.
