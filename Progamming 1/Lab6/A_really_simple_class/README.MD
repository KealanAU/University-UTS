<b>A Really Simple Class</b>

This time, we'll do the inverse of the previous exercise. We'll write the code for an empty class.

We start with an empty file (correctly named, so no need to worry about that). The task is to create a public class named Foo.

It doesn't need any members of any kind, they won't hurt the test, but they aren't necessary.

You also have a second class called Runner, that's just there so the run button does something. You can use it for your own testing, but it's not part of the tests, so if it's broken, that's okay.
