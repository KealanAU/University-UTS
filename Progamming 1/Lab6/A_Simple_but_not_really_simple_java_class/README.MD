<b>A Simple, but not Really Simple Java Class</b>
Our first "functional" class will be a rather pointless wrapper for a variable.

The scaffold has a file called StringWrapper.java, in this file create a class called StringWrapper that:

    Has a single private data member. It should have type String.

    Has a constructor that takes no parameters and sets the value of the data member to the empty string ("").

    Has a public method setValue(String) that takes a String as a parameter and sets the value of the data member to the value of the parameter, and returns nothing.

    Has a public method getValue() that returns the value of the data member as a String.

The scaffold also has a Runner class in the file Runner.java, as per the other exercises, this just provides a main method if you want to run anything.
