<b>Sequencing Overlapping Conditions</b>

Now we'll make use of the elif and nested if statements to handle multiple overlapping conditions, nothing too tricky though. An important planning step here is to read all the conditions and choose which order they need to be evaluated for the best result.

As always, we'll read in an int from the user, then:

    If the number is between 5 and 10 (inclusive) and isn't 7, add 2 to it.

    If the number is less than 5 and even, halve it.

    If the number is 7, add 1 to it.

    If the number is less than 5 and odd, or greater than 10, triple it.

Just to be clear, you don't need print out the value, you should modify the value of n.
