<b>Choosing Your Condition Carefully</b>

For this exercise, we'll shift things a little (but not much). The user will enter a single char which will be a lower case letter (you don't have to check, you can assume this). If the char is a vowel (a, e, i, o or u), print out "Vowel", if the char is a consonant, print out "Consonant".

There are several ways to do this, but you may want to review the material on operators, particularly the logical ones.

You may find it useful to know that a single character literal in Java is surrounded by single quote marks (') - for example, to write the literal for the character a, you would write 'a'. (As a side note, Python uses both " and ' to denote strings, there's no basic single character type.)
