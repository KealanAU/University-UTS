<b>Practice With Different Operators</b>

For this one you have most of the code, all you have to do is implement a boolean expression for the if statement that satisfies the requirements below.

As usual so far, the user will enter a number. If the number is divisible by 3 and greater than or equal to 53, or odd and less than 12, the code should print out "This number is special", and "This number is not special" otherwise.

Again, you don't have to worry about the input or output, you only have to fill in the condition.

You may want to consider the following operators:

    % - the mod operator (a % b is remainder when a is divided by b)

    > , >=, <, <= - the comparison operators

    ==, != - equality operators

    &&, || - boolean operators
