<b>Looping over a list</b>
Now we'll try the Python version of the previous exercise. As before, you start with a large list, the task is to print out the length of the list, then contents of the list, in order, each element on a separate line.

This can be solved essentially the exact same ways as in Java, but Java will naturally lead to one solution, Python will lead to another.
