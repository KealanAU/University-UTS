<b>User Controlled Loop</b>

For this exercise, we're going to look at building a loop with an unknown number of repetitions.

The program will ask for user input with the phrase "Please enter an action: " without a newline, then do the following things, depending on what is entered:

    The character x : print "Bye!" and exit the program.

    The character u : print "You go one square up.".

    The character d : print "You go one square down.".

    The character l : print "You go one square left.".

    The character r : print "You go one square right.".

    The character s : print "You search the square for treasure. You find nothing.".

    The character h : print "You hide, waiting for enemies to come by. It gets boring after about an hour and a half, so you give up.".

    The character e : print "You eat some food. You regain 0 hit points."

    Anything else : print "I don't understand."

You may assume that each of these response messages is printed out on its own line (i.e., just use println).
