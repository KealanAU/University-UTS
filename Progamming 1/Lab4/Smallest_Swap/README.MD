<b>Smallest Swap</b>

This exercise will require the searching and manipulation of an array using loops.

The program will read in a positive integer nnn from input. You should then add code to

    Create an array of that size.

    Read in that many numbers from the user (they will all be unique).

    Find the smallest number.

    Swap the smallest number with whatever is in the first cell of the array.

    Print out the numbers in the array in order each on a new line.

To keep things clean, there will be no additional prompts or print outs for this one.

For example, if 3 was entered, an array of size 3 should be created. If then the numbers 4, 5, 2 where entered, the program should print out
```
2
5
4
```
